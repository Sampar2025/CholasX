      "description": "The Kingspan Kooltherm K118 insulated plasterboard is a high-performance insulation board designed to improve thermal efficiency in both new and existing buildings. It combines a rigid phenolic insulation core with a 12.5mm tapered edge plasterboard, allowing for quick installation and maximum thermal efficiency with minimal thickness. Ideal for internal wall insulation, ceiling insulation, and loft conversions, the Kooltherm K118 helps reduce heat loss, resulting in lower energy bills and a more comfortable indoor environment.
